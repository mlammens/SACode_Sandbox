This repository includes a series of R functions used to implement Global Sensitivity Analysis for 
demographic models constructed using the RAMAS GIS software. On going development by @mlammens is
focusing on creating an R package using these scripts.

In addition to providing a tool to perform sensitivity analysis, these functions also provide a means
to interact with RAMAS GIS files more generally (i.e., read model config files, write files, etc.).
