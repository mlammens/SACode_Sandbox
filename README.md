==============

This repository includes a series of R functions used to implement Global Sensitivity Analysis for 
demographic models constructed using the RAMAS GIS software. 
All future development by @mlammens
focusing on creating an R package using these scripts can now be found in
[demgsa](https://github.com/mlammens/demgsa).

In addition to providing a tool to perform sensitivity analysis, these functions also provide a means
to interact with RAMAS GIS files more generally (i.e., read model config files, write files, etc.).
